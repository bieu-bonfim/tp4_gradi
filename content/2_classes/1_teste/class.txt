Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.</p><p><strong>Archery</strong></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><p><strong>Blind Fighting</strong></p><p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb\">blinded</a> or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#invisible_phb\">invisible</a> creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p><p><strong>Defense</strong></p><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><p><strong>Dueling</strong></p><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><p><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong></p><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><p><strong>Interception</strong></p><p>When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#shield_phb\">shield</a> or a <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstcategory:basic=1,flsttype:martial%20weapon=1~simple%20weapon=1\">simple or martial weapon</a> to use this reaction.</p><p><strong>Protection</strong></p><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><p><strong>Superior Technique</strong></p><p>You learn one <a href=\"https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#blankhash,flstfeature%20type:mv%3ab=1\">maneuver</a> of your choice from among those available to the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/classes.html#fighter_phb,state:sub-battle-master-phb=b1~feature=s2-0,fltsource:clear,flstmiscellaneous:clear\">Battle Master</a> archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p><p>You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting</strong></p><p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p><p>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p><p><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong></p><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><p><strong>Unarmed Fighting</strong></p><p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#shield_phb\">shield</a> when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.</p><p>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb\">grappled</a> by you.</p>"},"id":"a31b3f3c-0377-4951-b438-cfe0d1341dd8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<strong>Second Wind</strong>"},"id":"25c3fc38-3d8b-4508-92ce-bcd4561466bc","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm.
